## Staff+ Distributed Systems Engineer

###  Our Principles
___ 

#### Self-reliance

- Don’t ask for permission - we have a [constraint culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLQ-rq4FgQA&t=2920s), not a permission culture.
- Own your work. Establishing your own objectives and timelines. 
- Initiative is key; don't wait for tasks to be handed to you or rely solely on predefined roles. If you would like to be managed you should work somewhere else.
- No middle managers - we will never have managers which means you are your manager. You will have agency in your work. 
- Communicate directly and speak openly. 

#### Focus

- Efficient team - we believe in the effectiveness of small, dynamic teams that can compete with, and even outperform, larger traditional teams. 
- Reject waste - guard the company and your colleague's time, rather than wasting it in meetings without clear purpose/focus, or [bikeshedding](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Parkinsons-law-of-triviality-bikeshedding)_._

#### Production, speed, and excellence

- Embrace new challenges. You might be asked to do things that you've never done before. If you're not comfortable jumping into something new with no knowledge, you should work somewhere else. 
- Prioritize productivity - we are developing fundamental breakthroughs. Timing markets matters which means we need to deliver. Expect to work long hours, including weekends. If you do not want to work long hours, or if you're looking for a nice easy job, this is not for you.
- Situations do not self-resolve. Unresolved problems have [asymmetric risk](https://read.cash/@Vitalismo/5-take-aways-from-antifragile-by-nassim-taleb-e6b0cfd7#1-asymmetry) . Focus on the long term even if it makes you unpopular now. 
- Excellence. You should have an extraordinary high bar for your work. 
- Obsess over the details of your work. 

### Responsibilities

**Core contribution** - develop core protocol schema, decentralized registry infrastructure (solidity), server-to-server communication standards, network Node architectures in multiple programming languages (Go, Rust, Typescript), key pair infrastructure, CLIs, and developer tools. Develop and maintain mobile libraries for private key stores, design trusted execution environment gateways using Intel SGX.

**Research** - build and define new cryptographic standards, cryptographic proving systems, game theoretic research, consensus algorithms, and zero knowledge applications.

**Code reviews** - maintain our high code quality standard

**Open source** - build in the open with a keen focus on designing, testing, and documenting your code. We intend to build the network in public with users of the protocol.

**Write & engage** - contribute to technical reports/papers describing the network and the overarching technical standards. Collaborate with academic research partners at leading institutions.

**Customer support** - we don't shelter engineering teams. Expect to collaborate directly with stakeholders on how best to improve the protocol. 

**Management** - you will oversea a team of backend and frontend developers.

**Mobile + Web** - we manage 3 mobile products (iOS and Android), and 3 web products (React). Expect to oversee the development of, and directly contribute to all 6 of these products.

**Product Manager** - we don't hire product managers. Which means you will be in charge of creating your own tickets and holding yourself, as well as the team, accountable. You should be comfortable managing business requirements and defining product roadmaps yourself. If you don't have enough information to make a decision, you should seek the information instead of waiting for it. You should hold the team accountable to the same standard. 

### Minimum requirements
